          "p3": "Since that time, we have been working continuously to further develop this form of therapy and the devices – together with experts from research and application. As a result, we set new standards again and again, whether in output and wavelength, in safety during use, or in simplicity of operation.",
          "p4": "With over 20 years of experience and more than 10,000 systems sold worldwide, Zimmer MedizinSysteme is one of today’s leading providers. Hospitals, physiotherapists and physicians throughout the world use our high-energy Opton lasers every day and rely on their therapeutic effect.",
          "p5": "Laser therapy – Achieve therapeutic success with the speed of light",
          "p6": "Therapy with laser light is a widely used method in physical therapy.",
          "p7": "Laser therapy is a treatment with high-energy light which introduces large quantities of light into the tissue. As a result, healing is stimulated in a sustained manner.",
          "p8": "In particular, high-power laser therapy in which high intensities are used is becoming increasingly important.",

          "p12": "The laser light is output via an ergonomically shaped laser applicator which is equipped with an adjustable manual switch. By double-clicking once, the laser light is now emitted continuously, without any further action needed from the user. This ensures maximum convenience in handling for the user.",
          "p13": "Spacers",
          "p14": "2 different spacers which can be quickly and easily exchanged hold the laser applicator at a defined distance from the skin.",

          "p24": "In particular, the wavelength of 1064 nm which has the lowest scatter in the tissue promotes penetration of the radiation into the deep layers of tissue.",
          "p25": "The advantage of laser therapy with high power",
          "p26": "More power increases the power density in the tissue and this results in an increase in the thermal effect in deeper layers as well.",

        "p1": "Some of the laser energy is converted into chemical reaction energy, thereby stimulating molecules directly through the transfer of electrons and indirectly through the formation of oxygen radicals. Of primary importance are coloured molecules of the respiratory chain, such as flavoproteins and cytochromes. The result is increased activity of the energy metabolism, called “biostimulation”. The stimulation of the energy metabolism in the cellular respiratory chain also manifests as faster healing of tissue lesions. This effect is independent of the thermal effects of laser light.",
        "header2": "Regenerative effects",
        "p2": "The described acceleration of healing processes primarily manifests in the form of fibroblast activation. It is important to note the non-thermal nature of this activation, meaning that only small amounts of laser energy are required. The attenuation of the laser light in the tissue depends on the localisation of the lesion and determines the laser power required, thus deeper structures such as tendons or joint capsules may require the application of high doses to the surface.",
        "header3": "Reflexive effects",
        "p3": "Segmental reflexes that are activated by laser light cause muscle relaxation as well as inhibiting pain. This requires strong thermal stimuli.",
        "header4": "Analgesic effects",
        "p4": "Laser light is scattered and absorbed in the skin and therefore largely converted into heat. A mild thermal stimulus to the nociceptors of the skin triggers the known segmental pain-inhibition reflexes through the first-order and second-order neuron as described in the gate-control theory. Strong thermal stimuli activate the neural and humoral endorphinergic pain‑inhibition system. Both mechanisms are suitable for the treatment of pain in the musculoskelettal system."

    "p42": "Original quiet design to maintain a quiet treatment environment",
    "p43": "Through the adoption of a low noise “Minato Medical Science only” pump and new shape nozzle optimized for the dry hydro jet massage bed, the pump operation noise and water flow noise have been minimized. Further, through an original design and mechanism, the mechanical noise of the radiator and radiator fan have been reduced. Maintains a quiet treatment environment.",
    "p44": "Water cooling function that enables comfortable treatment even in summer",
    "p45": "The dry hydro jet massage bed generates heat from its high energy water flow-compatible pump. Normally the radiator fan is operated to cool this heat, but the QZ-240 has been equipped with a wide variety of cooling modes, from efficient cooling methods to the original “FULLAUTO water cooling” in which the cooling fan is not run at all. In this way, the bed water temperature will not increase even in summer and comfortable treatment is possible. (For the water cooling system, a plumbing is required)",
    "p46": "With the water cooling system, it automatically keeps the set temperature. As there is no cooling fan running, a quite treatment environment can be achieved.",
    "p47": "Mode in which water cooling and air cooling are used together. Normally this is controlled with air cooling and when used for continuous high output and the temperature rises, water cooling is also used to control the set temperature.",
    "p48": "Temperature controlled through air cooling. Water cooling is performed to avoid the occurrence of work restrictions.",
    "p49": "Spot water cooling",
    "p50": "Water cooling mode operated manually when the water temperature rises or lunch break.",
    "p51": "Healing sounds create a relaxation space",
    "p52": "It is equipped with a stereo system that allows relaxation sounds that use natural sounds as their materials to flow into your ears during treatment. Both your body and mind are enveloped in a healing space that not only treats your body but also calms your mind. Further, it also includes a chime function to notify you of the completion of treatment. In addition to volume control, you can freely choose the melody and chime sound to suit your taste.",
    "p53": "Merits for the medical staff",
    "p54": "Operability is further improved through the precise design",
    "p55": "Treatment time setting",
    "p56": "SLOW mode setting",
    "p57": "Wide jet setting",
    "p58": "Massage position setting",
    "p59": "Massage Intensity setting",
    "p60": "Program setting",
    "p61": "Massage Mode setting",
    "p62": "Airbag Intensity setting",
    "p63": "Equipped with sensor to automatically detect the position of your head",
    "p64": "When the patient lies down on the bed, the sensor detects the position of your head. It automatically measures your height and sets the optimal massage position. There is no need to separately set the height as before and this greatly reduces the workload of the staff.",
    "p65": "Operating panel that is easy to understand and easy to use",
    "p66": "The diverse range of treatment variations and massage modes of the QZ-240 can be set simply from the operating panel with the LED display. The treatment time, program, and massage intensity can be set in detail simply by touching the panel. This enables the provision of massages optimized to suit the respective conditions of the patients in a smooth way. In addition, the operating panel is at a height where it can be used while standing, and the angle can be adjusted freely within 360° in accordance with the installed location.",
    "p67": "Timer function to preheat in line with the treatment start time",
    "p68": "If the treatment start time is set for each day, the preheat function will operate in accordance with that time, and it will be in standby, in an instantly usable state when treatment begins. Time is not taken up adjusting the temperature."
